I am writing to express my keen interest in the hourly student Web Developer position within HUB IT, as advertised. My academic background in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Washington, coupled with extensive hands-on experience in web development and software engineering, has equipped me with the vital skills and knowledge required to significantly contribute to the HUB's mission of enhancing the UW community through dynamic event centers and fostering student engagement.

During my tenure as a Software Engineer with Ningbo ResChain Supply Chain Technology Co., LTD., I single-handedly developed 'iShipment', a full-stack application that has resulted in a 29\% annual cost saving for the company by eliminating outsourcing expenses. This project not only underscored my proficiency with React.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and AWS but also highlighted my capability to innovate and deliver tailored solutions that address specific business needs. My upcoming role as a Software Development Engineer Intern at Tesla Inc., where I will be instrumental in building a new analytics platform, further attests to my commitment to advancing my skills in a practical setting.

What excites me about the opportunity at HUB IT is the chance to apply my technical skills within a vibrant, community-focused environment. I am particularly drawn to the prospect of collaborating with the OSP Program Coordinator to enhance the functionality and user experience of the HUB and OSP websites. My strong foundation in SQL, MySQL, PHP, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, along with a deep understanding of WordPress and experience with version control using Git and GitHub, positions me well to tackle the challenges presented in the job description.

Moreover, my involvement in diverse projects has honed my soft skills, notably in organization, structured thinking, and time management. I am confident in my ability to work autonomously while effectively managing multiple tasks and deadlines. My professional experiences have imbued me with a customer-centric approach, ensuring that I always seek to understand and meet the needs of end-users.

I am eager to bring my technical expertise, problem-solving capabilities, and passion for web development to the HUB IT team, contributing to a welcoming and inspiring environment for all members of the UW community. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and enthusiasms align with the goals of HUB IT.

Thank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to the possibility of contributing to your team and to further discuss how I can support the HUB's mission.
