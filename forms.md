Software Development Engineer Intern | Go, TypeScript, React, Gin, Flask, Azure, Docker | Fremont, CA
Tesla, Inc. June 2024 -- Jan. 2025

Maintained and enhanced a large-scale in-house BI App transitioned from Tableau, enabling advanced data analytics and seamless creation of charts and dashboards by directly connecting to Tesla databases, which supports 12,000 daily active users across Tesla employees in the United States, Europe, and China.

Co-developed 2.0 version of the App, a cutting-edge application integrating all features of its predecessor and introducing a comprehensive suite of AI tools, setting it apart from the Apache Superset-based 1.0 version.

Designed and implemented an in-house Stack Overflow-like App, adopted by multiple teams to replace Tesla's Mattermost discussion groups, which is leveraging senior staff's community support time from over 20 hours to less than 5 hours weekly, with comprehensive features, AI search engines, and in-house data pre-trained LLM assistants, to automate the responses and gamified the community.

Software Engineer (Remote, Part-Time) | TypeScript, React, Express, MongoDB, AWS, Docker | Seattle, WA
Ningbo ResChain Supply Chain Technology Co., LTD. (Startup) Sep. 2023 -- May 2024

Self-engineered a full-stack application, iShipment, for the startup forwarder enterprise as a co-founder.

Developed iShipment as a subset of traditional SaaS systems provided by outsourcing companies, it utilizes the React framework, Express server, MongoDB database, and AWS deployment. iShipment economizes ResChain 29% annually to bring outsourcing 0 expenses as a startup. It is tailored to retain only the essential features needed by ResChain, minimizing usage complexity for business members, and operates under ResChain's direct control to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of customer resources, safeguarding against potential leaks and unauthorized access.

Software Development Intern | Flask, PyTorch, Optuna, Express, PostgreSQL, Docker | Ningbo, China
MIT Global SCALE Network May 2023 -- Sep. 2023

Developed a back-end server using Flask, coupled with an Express intermediary adapter, to efficiently connect with the client's (Jusda) PostgreSQL database and Express front-end server. This architecture ensured seamless data integration and optimized performance so that the system response prediction was within 3 ms, all while preserving the client's established system framework.

Designed a Neural Network with the professor team for the client to predict the vessel's ETA based on the raw shipments' GPS data given by them. The deliverable model's RMSE reached 7.93 and adjusted R2 reached 0.93 by Optuna hyperparameter optimization, for the trajectory between the USWC and Eastern China, the client can predict within half a day's error.

Communicated between the client and the non-Chinese speaker professor team as a technical communicator to overcome technical barriers between both business-side teams.

Research Assistant (Remote) | PyTorch, pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, MATLAB | Nottingham, UK
University of Southern California May 2022 -- Sep. 2022

Contributed to developing a robust deep learning algorithm outperforming traditional algorithms as a partial algorithm designer in an academic team with dozens of members supervised by Professor Paul Bogdan. The whole algorithm was tailored to analyze senile dementia patients' data from a California public hospital, and it leverages cutting-edge software engineering techniques and data-driven methodologies to optimize predictive accuracy and healthcare outcomes.

Data Center Intern | JavaScript, React, Express, R, MySQL, Python |Xinyu, China
State Grid Corporation of China May 2021 -- Sep. 2021

Implementing a revolutionized React framework that allows around $90\%$ of team members to transform from stale workflow to input new data in the front-end directly. The new solution will concatenate and organize the database at an Express back-end, then use MySQL to retrieve data for presenting basic required statistics and statistical graphs by R. This approach shrunk down over 25% of trivial working time.

EmailPoll | Python, Flask, TypeScript, React, PostgreSQL, OAuth, OpenAI
A Full-Stack App, perfect for posting surveys in an internal enterprise resource pool. | Aug. 2023

Used Flask to serve cross-platform APIs and React front-end with GitHub OAuth for abuse prevention.

Included unsubscribing method, visualization trends for bi-sides, and images-text interchanging model features.
